### What is a Charge Card?

A Charge Card is a type of MasterCard Credit Card offering a credit facility, usually associated with a NatWest Black bank account. Customers who have been issued with a Charge Card are required to pay the full balance each month by Direct Debit from funds held in their Black account.

Commonly, there are 2 types of card, the NatWest Gold Plus Charge Card and the NatWest Advantage Premier Charge Card.

Customers with a Charge Card are usually able to view recent statements and manage the card within their Online Banking service.
