# Why is the ISA I am trying to credit currently unable to accept deposits?

### Why is the ISA I am trying to credit currently unable to accept deposits?

This may be because the ISA has not had any activity within the last tax year and needs to be re-activated.

In order to reactivate your ISA for it to accept deposits again, please see [How do I reactivate my Cash or Help to Buy: ISA?](https://www.natwest.com/support-centre/help-with-your-product/savings/reactivate-an-isa.html) for more information.
