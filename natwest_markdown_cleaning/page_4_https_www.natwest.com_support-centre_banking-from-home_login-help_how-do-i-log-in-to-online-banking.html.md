# How do I log in to Online Banking?

### How do I log in to Online Banking?

You can log in to Online Banking a couple of different ways depending on what information you have available at the time.

### If you have your customer number or card number, PIN and password

For extra security, we may sometimes ask you for a one-time passcode to make sure it’s you who’s logging in to Online Banking. If we have your mobile details, we’ll send you a one-time passcode to your device. Otherwise, you can generate one using your card reader.

To log in:

1. Go to Online Banking.
2. Enter your customer number or card number and select 'Log in'.
3. You'll be asked for three random characters from both your PIN and password. Type this then press 'Next'.
4. If you're asked for a one-time passcode, have your mobile phone or card reader handy.

### If you have your customer number or card number and activation code

To log in:

1. Go to Online Banking.
2. Enter your customer number and click on 'log in'.
3. Enter your activation code and click on 'Next'. You will then be asked to choose your PIN and password.
