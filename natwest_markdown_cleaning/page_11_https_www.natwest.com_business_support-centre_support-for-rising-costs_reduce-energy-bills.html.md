## Quick energy-saving tips for your business

1. 01

   **Switch energy providers**

   Switching energy providers is one of the easiest ways to cut energy bills. However, because of [changes in the energy market](https://www.uswitch.com/gas-electricity/guides/energy-market-explained/) (increasing wholesale energy prices and some suppliers folding) it’s difficult to find a deal at the moment. It’s still worth shopping around to see if there’s a better option out there though. Visit a comparison site before switching to help your decision.
2. 02

   **Review your energy usage**

   Check your energy usage over the previous 12 months and see when and where you're using the most. For help and support on calculating your business' energy usage visit [utilityswitchboard.com.](https://utilityswitchboard.com/gas-electricity/guides/business/calculating-usage/)
3. 03

   **Don’t leave things on standby**

   Turn off PCs and office equipment when you’re not using it. This one small thing could make a huge difference to your bill.
4. 04

   **Use energy-efficient equipment**

   Another way of cutting your costs could be to make sure you’re providing energy-efficient equipment. uswitch.com suggest that laptops are more energy efficient than a desktop and provide some [helpful energy savings tip to follow here](https://www.uswitch.com/energy-efficiency/tvs-computers-laptops/).
5. 05

   **See the light**

   Using energy-saving lightbulbs can also give you a small saving. According to the [Energy Saving Trust](https://energysavingtrust.org.uk/) switching from a 100w incandescent bulb to LED can save up to £13 per year (based on 1,100-luman bulb running for 562 hours per year).

   And it’s always a good idea to turn lights off when they’re not in use too – leaving them on could be bumping up your bills. The easiest way to curb this is by investing in a motion-sensor lighting system.
6. 06

   **Think about the temperature**

   Rather than turning the thermostat on full blast in the winter, consider managing the temperature to cut costs. You can turn down the thermostat at night or when staff are out of the office. [The Energy Saving Trust](https://energysavingtrust.org.uk/business/) says that even turning it down by one degree can save £85-£90 per year in a three-bed semi-detached house, so it could help reduce your business costs too. Checking for gaps in windows/doors and filling them or upping the amount of insulation could also help you reduce heat loss and ultimately save you money.
7. 07

   **Make sure everyone knows how to help**

   Getting your employees on board with energy saving is a great way to reduce your costs. Educate everyone on the benefits of energy efficiency so they can call out ways to save. And offering flexible or remote working could reduce the amount of office space, heating, lighting, and electricity you need to pay for as well.
