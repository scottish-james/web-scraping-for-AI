## What does remortgage mean?

Remortgaging means changing the mortgage you have on your home or property. You do this by getting a new deal with a different lender. The [remortgage process](https://www.natwest.com/mortgages/remortgage-to-natwest.html "remortgage to natwest") concludes with your old mortgage being repaid and a new mortgage being taken out with a different lender. This process happens without you moving home.

Whilst moving your mortgage to a new lender, you can also consider changing the [type of mortgage](https://www.natwest.com/mortgages/mortgage-comparison.html "compare mortgages"), how long you take to pay back the mortgage and to increase or decrease the amount you are borrowing.

When your current mortgage deal is coming to an end, you may wish to consider taking out a new deal with your existing lender before looking at moving your mortgage to a new one. If you do not get a new deal, when your existing one ends, you'll likely move onto a [Standard Variable Rate](https://www.natwest.com/mortgages/mortgage-comparison/standard-variable-rate-mortgage.html "standard variable rate") (also known as SVR) which may turn out to be more expensive.

## Why do people remortgage?

**There are several reasons people may wish to remortgage. Here are some common ones:**

* The current mortgage deal is due to finish.
* They’re currently on or within three months of moving onto your lender's [Standard Variable Rate](https://www.natwest.com/mortgages/mortgage-comparison/standard-variable-rate-mortgage.html "standard variable rate") (SVR) and want to lock in a better rate.
* [They want to borrow more money against the home](https://www.natwest.com/mortgages/mortgage-comparison/mortgage-debt-consolidation.html "learn about mortgage debt consolidation").
* They want to release [equity](https://www.natwest.com/mortgages/mortgage-guides/mortgage-equity.html "learn about mortgage equity") on the property.

**With NatWest, you can also be more flexible with your mortgage by:**

* overpaying up to 20% of your mortgage each year without incurring charges
* choosing to shorten your term or decrease your monthly payments when you overpay your mortgage
* helping you move home in the future. You can avoid paying early repayment charges by ‘porting’ your mortgage to a new property.

## How long does it take to remortgage?

The time it takes to remortgage can differ on a case-by-case basis, depending on several factors. It's recommended you begin considering a remortgage around 3 months before the end of an existing mortgage deal. This period can ensure you have enough time to research and apply for a remortgage.

## How to remortgage

Before you start the remortgage process, there are a few steps to follow to make sure remortgaging is right for you.

1. 1

   ### Find out what your property is worth

   Your new mortgage provider will need to know how much your current property is worth. You could find out an estimated value using online valuation tools or asking an estate agent to provide a valuation (some estate agents may charge for this service).

   If you decide to remortgage with NatWest, we will obtain our own valuation which may differ from other valuations obtained.
2. 2

   ### Check how much is left to pay

   Look at your last mortgage statement to see how much is left to pay on your current mortgage. This will be used as a guide to know how much you need to borrow for your next mortgage.
3. 3

   ### Apply for an Agreement in Principle (AIP)

   Once you’ve compared mortgages and found the right one for you, you can [complete a mortgage AIP](https://spa.mortgages.natwest.com/customer-experience "find out how much you could borrow") which will give you an indication of what we could lend you based on your remortgage requirements.
4. 4

   ### Compare our remortgage rates and deals

   Just enter a few details into our [mortgage calculator](https://www.natwest.com/mortgages/mortgage-calculators/how-much-can-i-borrow.html "use our mortgage calculator") to find out how much your monthly repayments might be. It only takes a few minutes and it could help you decide how much you would like to borrow.
5. 5

   ### Check all remortgage costs

   When considering all remortgage options, consider any additional costs that may be associated with the remortgage process:

   * **Interest rates vs product fee**- Understand the total remortgage costs, for example, considering a higher interest rate without a product fee vs a lower interest rate with a product fee.
   * **Valuation fee**- This is to confirm the property value. The cost will range depending on the value of the property.
   * **Broker fee**- If you opt to use a broker to help you remortgage, they should let you know if they charge a fee or if it’s a fee-free service.

   ### If you remortgage to NatWest

   If you move a mortgage to us from another provider, we'll pay your valuation and legal costs (exclusions apply).

   ### Apply for your mortgage

   ###

   Now that you have an AIP, you could be ready to [apply for your remortgage](https://www.natwest.com/mortgages/applying-for-a-mortgage.html "learn how to apply for a mortgage"). There are a few documents you’ll need to provide such as, proof of ID, proof of income, financial circumstances (loans or credit commitments) and current mortgage details.

7. 7

   ### Final step for completing a remortgage

   ###

   The lender will carry out various checks to verify your current circumstances and will arrange for the property to be valued to enable the remortgage product to be approved.

## Getting prepared to remortgage

You can view and compare the deals you may be eligible for by completing an [Agreement in Principle](https://spa.mortgages.natwest.com/customer-experience "get an agreement in principle"), it’s a personalised indication of what we could offer you.

Alternatively, you can arrange to speak to a mortgage professional to help discuss your options. [Contact us](#help "contact us") if you need help with your mortgage.

The following steps can help you understand your current situation and requirements before applying for a remortgage.

### 1. Look out for exit or repayment fees

Unless you're at the end of an existing mortgage deal, you may have to pay an Early Repayment Charge (ERC) depending on your current mortgage obligations. Check your paperwork for an ERC, if you're unsure, contact your mortgage provider to get the details.

These fees are also something to consider when looking for your new mortgage.

Information Message

### 2. What do you need from your next mortgage?

Depending on your situation and requirements, the lowest interest rate may not always be the best option.

For example, you might find that a more flexible mortgage with a higher interest rate that allows you to easily exit the mortgage, is better suited for you.

If you are unsure, you can always speak to a mortgage professional to understand your options.

Information Message

### 3. Check your credit score

As the lender will be making a credit check to assess your circumstances, it can be beneficial to review your [credit score](https://www.natwest.com/borrowing-needs/credit-scoring-guide.html "learn about credit scoring") details to ensure there are no mistakes in your credit history and to see if there are any quick-wins that may help improve your score, before submitting your mortgage application.

## Frequently asked questions

[### My current mortgage deal is ending soon. When should I remortgage?](#contextualhelp_copyaccordion_0_preapplystart188002)

It's generally a good idea to start looking for a remortgage around three months before your current mortgage deal ends. This should give you enough time to research the different options available and complete the application process to ensure your remortgage deal begins alongside the end of your previous one.

[### Can I add another party to my mortgage when I remortgage?](#contextualhelp_copyaccordion_1_preapplystart431768)

Yes, it is possible to add another party when you remortgage. This means your mortgage would become a [joint mortgage](https://www.natwest.com/life-moments/buying-a-home/joint-mortgages.html "read about joint mortgages").

As per any mortgage application, you will both need to provide detailed information for your application, including proof of income and will be subject to affordability checks and credit score assessments.

[### Can I remortgage to the same lender?](#contextualhelp_copyaccordion_2_preapplystart189664)

When you get to the end of a mortgage deal, it's certainly possible to arrange a new deal with the same lender, before you move onto the [Standard Variable Rate](https://www.natwest.com/mortgages/mortgage-comparison/standard-variable-rate-mortgage.html "learn about the standard variable rate") (SVR).

As you wouldn't be moving lender, this wouldn't be classed as a 'remortgage'. At NatWest, we call this '[switching to a new deal](https://www.natwest.com/mortgages/switch-mortgage-deal.html "switch your mortgage deal")'.

[### Can I remortgage between NatWest Group brands?](#contextualhelp_copyaccordion_3_preapplystart341315)

No, mortgage customers of NatWest Group are unable to remortgage between our brands (NatWest, Royal Bank of Scotland and Ulster Bank Northern Ireland).

However, if your current mortgage deal is coming to an end, you may be able to switch to a new deal with your current brand within our mortgage self-service portals.
