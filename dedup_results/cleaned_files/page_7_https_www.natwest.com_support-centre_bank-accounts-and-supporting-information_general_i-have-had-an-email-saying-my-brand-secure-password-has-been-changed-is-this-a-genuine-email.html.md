### I have had an email saying my NatWest Secure password has been changed. Is this a genuine email?

We no longer use NatWest Secure passwords. The static NatWest Secure password has been replaced with a one-time passcode.

For some transactions you may be asked to enter the passcode online. You can select whether you wish this passcode to be sent to your mobile, email address or by voicemail to your landline.

NatWest Secure provides you with additional protection when shopping online at participating merchants, and you should not have received an email asking you to change your password.

If you suspect the email you have received is not genuine, please call NatWest Secure.
