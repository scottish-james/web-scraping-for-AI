We answer the most common queries regarding borrowing for commercial property

# Commercial Mortgages Explained

Security may be required. Product fees may apply. Over 18s only. Subject to status, business use only. Any property or asset used as security may be repossessed or forfeited if you do not keep up repayments on any debt secured on it.

## Types of commercial mortgages

When applying for a commercial mortgage, there are two options. The difference is in the type of interest rate on the mortgage, with a fixed or variable interest rate to choose from.

### Fixed interest rate

A fixed interest rate commercial mortgage gives you the security of predictable repayments. As the interest rate is fixed, it means the cost of your repayments won’t change throughout the term. Over the life of the loan, a fixed rate might end up costing you more than a variable rate if interest rates go down.

Information Message

### Variable interest rate

Variable interest rate commercial mortgages use a rate of interest that varies in accordance with the NatWest Bank base rate.

Information Message

Variable interest rate borrowers: Changes in the NatWest Bank base rate will affect the amount you need to pay to fully repay your loan. If you repay your loan from an account with NatWest or via Direct Debit, we will automatically adjust your repayments to reflect changes in the NatWest Bank base rate going forward (or, wherever possible, let you know if we are not able to do so for whatever reason). If you repay your loan via standing order from an externally banked account, we will be in touch to let you know the next steps required to adjust your repayments accordingly.

## Can you take out a residential mortgage on commercial property?

The simple answer is no, you cannot use a homebuyer mortgage on properties designated for business use. Residential mortgages can only be used for residential properties, not for commercial or mixed-use. As commercial property is higher risk than a home, the rates are tailored to reflect that and differ to those of a residential mortgage.

## Can a commercial mortgage be used for a small business?

If you run a small or medium enterprise and you are looking for an SME mortgage to purchase commercial property, a commercial mortgage can be tailored to suit your needs. With a minimum borrowing amount of £25,001 and term lengths up to 25 years, you are welcome to apply as a new or small business.

How does NatWest make a lending decision?

We make all assessments of eligibility for lending on the basis of the credit history of the individual, business owners or directors. Credit Scoring is part of the process used by banks and other lenders to help assess the risk involved in a specific loan and to determine whether they will lend to you.

How to appeal a business lending decision

Hopefully we can approve the loan for you. However, we have strict lending criteria, so sometimes we have to decline.

How can I improve my chances of being approved?

If you're an existing customer, it’s really important that your personal and business details are close matches to what we have on your file. If they're different, it will be worth updating them before you apply.

If in doubt, please check what is on file at [Companies House](https://www.gov.uk/get-information-about-a-company) and update any out of date information before you apply.

Please be accurate with your income declaration. If we believe you can't afford the repayments on the amount you apply, you may be declined.

For instance, if you declare an income of £250,000 and we see £180,000 going through your NatWest account, your application may be referred or declined.

See our credit scoring guide

When you apply for a loan, we’ll look at your credit score. Our Business Credit Scoring Guide can help you manage your application.
