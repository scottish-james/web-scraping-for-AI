We spoke to Lily about her business, her experience of the Accelerator and what being an entrepreneur means to her.

Manchester-based ekointelligence have created an AI-powered software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform to help organisations address the growing problem of greenwashing and navigate the complexities of ESG compliance.

By analysing corporate data, it detects greenwashing and ensures transparency between claims and actions.

Co-founder of ekointelligence, which helps businesses address greenwashing, Lily told us about her how the Accelerator is helping her first steps as an entrepreneur.

## Greenwashing has become a major concern in the corporate world. Can you explain what it means in simple terms?

“Greenwashing occurs when companies make misleading claims about the environmental benefits of their products or services. For example, a product might be labelled as ‘green’ or ‘eco-friendly’, but in reality, it could be contributing to environmental harm. Many consumers trust these labels, and our platform aims to reveal the truth behind those claims, enabling better choices.

“We’re targeting a range of industries such as audit and law firms, retail, real estate, and financial services. Essentially, any company that could be accused of greenwashing is our focus, but we also look at larger corporations, as they should be more invested in environmental matters.”

## You're currently testing your product with three potential customers. How did you find them?

"Finding them was a bit challenging since I transitioned from a 9-to-5 job, but I networked through LinkedIn and various events. It’s important to reach out, and although it’s intimidating, I’ve met many friendly people open to hearing about my ideas.”

## What inspired you to take this leap into business?

“It started with my co-founder raising concerns about his pension funds, which were labelled as sustainable but were actually funding not-so-eco-friendly initiatives. As we researched, we realised greenwashing is a huge issue across various industries.

“I’ve always wanted to start a business but thought it was something I’d pursue later in life. However, I decided to act now since the problem is so pressing.”

## How do you feel about being called an entrepreneur?

“I still struggle with imposter syndrome. I feel like to call myself an entrepreneur, I should have a business which has been around for many years but I do take pride in running one. The journey has been eye-opening, and I’m learning a lot every day.”

## Has anyone been instrumental in supporting you on that entrepreneurial journey?

“My co-founders have been incredibly supportive given their past experiences in entrepreneurship. They offer valuable advice and encouragement. Additionally, the NatWest Accelerator’s networking opportunities and resources have been essential for my growth.”

## Has ekointelligence been self-funded so far?

“Yes, we’re currently self-funded, but we’re considering fundraising at the start of next year. After attending a recent workshop on funding, I've learned there are multiple routes to explore, like grants and loans, rather than solely relying on outside investment.”

Talking to others in the Accelerator helps. Celebrating small wins and taking breaks are crucial for me. I try not to dwell too much on rejections; instead, I focus on progress.

## How do you keep yourself motivated?

“It can be challenging, but talking to others in the Accelerator helps. Celebrating small wins and taking breaks are crucial for me. I try not to dwell too much on rejections; instead, I focus on progress.”

## If you could wish someone told you something before starting this journey, what would it be?

“I wish I had been told more about the importance of prioritising my health. It’s easy to get caught up in work, but maintaining physical and mental wellness is key to longevity in this field.”

## What’s next for you in terms of product development and customer acquisition?

“We’re refining our product based on customer feedback. We aim to ramp up our marketing and outreach efforts at the end of this year once we’re confident that our product aligns with customer needs.”

## Pitching your business is key, how has Accelerator helped with that?

“I’m a bit nervous about my first pitch coming up, but the preparation opportunities provided by the NatWest Accelerator have been fantastic. They have pitch clubs here which is helpful. You can pitch in like a safe space, so that will really help me.”
