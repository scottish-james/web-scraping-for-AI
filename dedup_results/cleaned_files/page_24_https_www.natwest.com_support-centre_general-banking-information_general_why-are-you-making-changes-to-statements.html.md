Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) regulatory guidance means we need to capture and record your consent to stay on quarterly statements. We're asking for this consent via SMS, email or letter depending on what information we hold, so please check we have a valid and up-to-date email address and mobile number for you.

We'll need you to respond otherwise we’ll switch you to monthly statements.

If you're not sure what details we have on record, log into Online Banking and click on "Your Details" in the main menu. You'll then see the email address and mobile phone number we have for you.
